# REGEX and Relax: A Tutorial Gist On Matching An Email 

A regular expression, or regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern.  It can be used to find certain patters of characters within a string, in this case an email.  

This tutorial demonstarates how a regex functions by breaking down each part of an email expression and describing what it does.  


## Summary

In this gist, I provide a tutorial of how the regex ```/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/``` is used to match an email value and how each component works.

The different parts of the above email regex have specific roles in ensuring that a user inputs an email address that starts with an undetermined amount of characters before the @ symbol and ends with a domain name.
